# Purpose

MasterIT is a web application dedicated to internship programs for an IT company which follows the Scrum framework. It brings together both the interns and mentors assigned to them and facilitates the communication between those two parts. 
On the one side, MasterIT helps the mentors organize better their time with their interns, by push notifications to be prepared for Scrum meetings and more features. On the other side, this application helps interns get to know better and easily the Scrum methodology and how useful it is in a company. Also, interns can discover their progress by taking the final exam their mentors made in particular for them.
